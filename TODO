A to-do list for the Gviz package

General
   o fix the tables in vignette (xtable instead of kableExtra)
   o check that alpha works correctly

AnnotationTrack/GeneRegionTrack
   o speed up .prepareGene (may need a C code module)
   o deal with additional annotation features (UTRs, etc.)

DataTrack/AnnotationTrack => SNPsTrack?
   o issue: #5
   o new track type to hnadle LD information
   o ideally as heatmap, with defined depth (range)
   o check following: snpStats (data structure), ldblock, gwascat 
   o similar thing already implemented in LDheatmap
